# Tech stack

Several packages were used for this development. But the most important ones would be the following:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for building dynamic UI

# Tests 
To run unit and integration tests, you'll need to run:  
`yarn test`

To check the project's test coverage, you'll need to run:  
`yarn coverage` - this will serve the test coverage in your browser  
or  
`yarn test --coverage` - this will print the coverage report in the terminal

# Changelog generation
Every project should have a changelog so every one can have an understanding about the project's evolution at each version.  
For that we have [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) along with [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to automatically generate a changelog from the project's history.

To generate the changelog file you'll  need to run:  
`yarn changelog`
